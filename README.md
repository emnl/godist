Godist distributes your incoming tcp connections between servers, balancing the load. A thin high-performance layer between your servers and the world.

Written in Go. Built for concurrency.

## Usage
Godist requires a configuration file to setup the most basic settings. The software will look for **godist.conf** by default. You can specify your own configuration file by passing it as an argument.

**godist.conf**

    {
		"Host": "localhost:8080",
		"Servers":
			["localhost:4000", 
			 "localhost:4001",
			 "localhost:4002"]
	}

Then:

    $ godist godist.conf

### Distributing connections
The incoming connections are distributed by hashing the ip and port. An ip and port will always get the same server handling its connection.

## Build & Install
Godist is exceptionally easy to build and install. Just clone the repo and execute one of the following commands.

    $ go build

Will get you a ./**godist** binary.

    $ go install

Installs the **godist** binary to your *GOPATH*/bin.

    $ go run main.go

Useful during debug.
